## HOME PAGE > What It Is  
## Headline  
**An operating system for recovery.**  
## Body Copy (3 paragraphs)  
**Para 1 (What it is):** RecoveryOS isn’t a program you follow. It’s a system that runs. A spine that stays stable while life moves. The interface can change. The language can evolve. The operating truth doesn’t drift.  
**Para 2 (What it does):** It senses the moment, routes the next right move, delivers it inside real life, then seals what held as proof. Not as a diary. As a trace the brain trusts. Moments become receipts. Receipts become default.  
**Para 3 (Who it’s for):** One spine, three lenses. For the individual, it’s orientation and proof. For the professional, it’s continuity between sessions. For the organisation, it’s integrity at scale—governed delivery you can stand behind.

## HOW IT WORKS PAGE > Hero  
## Headline  
**Sense. Route. Deliver. Seal.**  
## Subtitle/Intro  
RecoveryOS runs as a loop. It doesn’t wait for ideal conditions. It meets real conditions, routes the right dose, delivers one move, then seals the result as proof. Run the loop enough times and the brain installs a new default.  
  
## HOW IT WORKS PAGE > SpineExplorer  
## Section Headline  
**The spine. Made tangible.**  
## Intro Copy  
The SpineExplorer shows how RecoveryOS stays stable while everything else adapts. Start at a glance. Zoom into threads. Follow a pillar into the mechanisms, themes, and schemas that route what happens next.  
## Pillar Tooltips/Cards (15–25 words each)  
**ER (Emotional Regulation):** Stabilises state in motion. Routes downshift, naming, and nervous-system alignment so choice stays available under load.  
**SR (Self-Repair):** Closes the loop after slip, rupture, or drift. Routes repair sequences that convert “that happened” into “I return.”  
**SC (Social Continuity):** Protects connection while life stresses it. Routes co-regulation, boundaries, and repair so relationships stop becoming triggers.  
**CR (Care Routing):** Delivers the right support at the right time. Routes modalities, primitives, and interactions into moments—without flooding or drift.  
**II (Integrity Infrastructure):** Makes trust verifiable. Routes consent, governance, and auditability so continuity scales without surveillance or ambiguity.  
**DM (Drift Monitoring):** Detects pattern movement early. Routes micro-checks and proof requests that catch drift before it becomes collapse.  
  
## HOW IT WORKS PAGE > ContinuityStream  
## Section Headline  
**From need to proof.**  
## Stage Descriptions (20–30 words each)  
**Routed:** The system grades the moment and selects one move: one target, one mechanism, one dose. It chooses what can hold now—not what’s ideal.  
**Delivered:** The move arrives in the flow of life. Not as homework. As a runnable micro-experience designed to land inside real conditions.  
**Sealed:** The outcome is captured as a receipt: what changed, what held, and what it cost. Not performance. Proof the brain trusts.  
**Reviewed:** Receipts are reflected back at the right cadence. Patterns become visible. Routing improves. Identity updates quietly from accumulated proof.  
  
## HOW IT WORKS PAGE > OrchestrationFeed  
## Section Headline  
**The conductor’s view.**  
## Feed Card 1 — “Why routed”  
**Title:** Why this move **Body:** Because the current state predicts a known pathway. This route interrupts the prediction with the smallest dose that can hold—then seals the result as proof.  
## Feed Card 2 — “What held”  
**Title:** What held under load **Body:** The move completed inside real conditions. The receipt shows the delta: pre → post, cost, and stability. Small win. High integrity. Repeatable.  
## Feed Card 3 — “What’s next”  
**Title:** What the system will try next **Body:** Routing doesn’t escalate by intensity. It escalates by precision—adjusting dose, primitive, and timing based on what held, what didn’t, and consent boundaries.  
  
## HOW IT WORKS PAGE > Proof  
## Section Headline  
**Proof that travels.**  
## Body Copy  
RecoveryOS seals receipts so progress can move across contexts. The same trace reinforces the individual, informs the professional, and protects the organisation. One artifact. Three interpretations. No translation layer. No loss of integrity.

## TRUST PAGE > Hero  
## Headline  
**Trust by architecture.**  
## Subtitle  
RecoveryOS treats trust as a system property. Consent is explicit. Quiet is enforced. Escalation is protocol-bound. Governance is visible. Every route is logged. Every change is sealed.  
  
## TRUST PAGE > TrustRails  
## Section Headline  
**Four rails. Always on.**  
**Rail 1 — Consent Map**  
**Title:** Consent is the control plane **Body:** You decide what the system can see, when it can speak, and who it can reach. Consent isn’t a prompt. It’s enforced routing logic—by default.  
**Rail 2 — Quiet Hours**  
**Title:** Boundaries that hold **Body:** RecoveryOS doesn’t demand attention. It respects it. Quiet hours are hard rails that shape delivery cadence so support stays usable, not intrusive.  
**Rail 3 — Escalation**  
**Title:** Safety net, not surveillance **Body:** When risk rises, the system tightens dose, changes primitive, or routes a stabilising sequence. If a human is needed, escalation happens cleanly—by consent, by protocol.  
**Rail 4 — Governance**  
**Title:** Visibility without ambiguity **Body:** Who can see what is always clear. Roles are explicit. Data boundaries are enforced. The spine remains stable while permissions adapt to context.  
  
## TRUST PAGE > Integrity Log  
## Section Headline  
**Every action. Every change. Sealed.**  
## Body Copy  
RecoveryOS maintains an integrity log of routing decisions, deliveries, consent events, and escalation steps. Not to police people—so continuity can be defended. Trust becomes verifiable because the system knows its boundaries.

## THREE WORLDS PAGE > Hero  
## Headline  
**One OS. Three altitudes.**  
## Subtitle  
RecoveryOS runs one operating truth across three lenses. Same spine. Same receipts. Different altitude. The person gets orientation. The professional gets continuity. The organisation gets integrity.  
  
## THREE WORLDS PAGE > Lens Comparison  
## Section Headline  
**Same receipt. Three meanings.**  
## Individual Lens  
**Headline:** Individual: Your moments **Body:** This lens is for the person living the day. It shows the move that was routed, what the body and mind did next, and the receipt that proves return. It’s not tracking. It’s orientation plus proof—quiet enough to use in real moments. **Key features (3 bullets):**  
* One move at a time, right-sized for the moment  
* Receipts that stack without performance  
* Review cadence that makes patterns visible  
## Professional Lens  
**Headline:** Professional: Care continuity **Body:** This lens is for practitioners supporting change beyond the room. It shows what the OS routed, what was delivered, what held, and where drift is forming. You see signal without noise—so sessions become strategic, not forensic. **Key features (3 bullets):**  
* Clean trace timeline: routed → delivered → sealed → reviewed  
* Pattern movement and stability signals  
* Escalation events and consent boundaries  
## Organisation Lens  
**Headline:** Organisation: System integrity **Body:** This lens is for leaders responsible for safety at scale. It shows governed delivery, adherence to rails, and continuity across handovers, discharge, and real life. Not bureaucracy—defensibility. Proof that the system behaved as designed. **Key features (3 bullets):**  
* Governance visibility and role-based access  
* Integrity logs you can audit  
* Continuity metrics without surveillance

Toggle the lens to change altitude—not the truth. Watch how the same receipt becomes identity reinforcement, clinical signal, and system defensibility. One artifact. Three views. No translation.  
  
## SPECS PAGE > Hero  
## Headline  
**Spine specification.**  
## Subtitle  
This page defines the RecoveryOS language, components, and stability model. Terms are stable. IDs don’t change. The interface can evolve without breaking continuity.  
  
## SPECS PAGE > Framework Glossary  
## Spine (30–50 words)  
The Spine is the stable architecture RecoveryOS routes through. Pillars anchor capacity domains. Mechanisms and schemas sit underneath. Language can evolve, but the Spine remains consistent so delivery and proof don’t drift across time or context.  
## Lens (30–50 words)  
A Lens is a governed viewpoint on the same underlying truth. Individual, Professional, and Organisation lenses render the same trace at different altitude—without changing the artifact or losing integrity.  
## Altitude (30–50 words)  
Altitude is the level of abstraction a lens operates at. Individual is moment and identity. Professional is continuity and pattern movement. Organisation is governance and defensibility. Same trace. Different meaning.  
## Trace (30–50 words)  
A Trace is the system record of what happened: the route chosen, what was delivered, what held, and what was sealed. It’s not a narrative. It’s structured signal that can travel across lenses.  
## Receipt (30–50 words)  
A Receipt is the smallest proof unit the brain trusts. It captures a delta: before/after, cost, and stability. Receipts stack without performance. Identity follows accumulated proof.  
## Seal (30–50 words)  
To Seal is to crystallise a moment into proof. Sealing captures what held under real conditions, attaches context, and locks integrity so the receipt remains valid as it travels.  
## Routed/Delivered/Sealed/Reviewed (30–50 words)  
These are the four continuity stages of RecoveryOS. Routed selects the next move. Delivered places it inside life. Sealed captures proof. Reviewed returns receipts on cadence to reveal patterns and improve routing.  
## Continuity (30–50 words)  
Continuity is support that doesn’t break between sessions, shifts, or environments. RecoveryOS creates continuity by routing in real time and sealing receipts that can be reviewed, shared by consent, and governed end to end.  
## Orchestration (30–50 words)  
Orchestration is the governed conductor layer that decides what happens next: the target, the dose, and the delivery format. It prevents noise by enforcing one move, one contract, one receipt.  
## Proof (30–50 words)  
Proof is the cumulative weight of sealed receipts. Not belief. Not understanding. Proof is what survives pressure. RecoveryOS uses proof to stabilise new predictions until they become default.  
## Rail (30–50 words)  
A Rail is an always-on constraint that shapes system behaviour. Rails enforce safety properties like consent, quiet, escalation protocols, and governance visibility. Rails are not content. They are infrastructure.  
## Consent Map (30–50 words)  
The Consent Map is the control plane for visibility and reach. It defines what the system can sense, when it can speak, and who it can contact. Consent isn’t asked repeatedly. It’s enforced continuously.  
## Quiet Hours (30–50 words)  
Quiet Hours are hard boundaries that limit delivery by time and cadence. They prevent flood, pressure, and dependency. Quiet is treated as a safety property—not a preference.  
## Escalation (30–50 words)  
Escalation is a protocol-bound path for when risk rises. The system can tighten dose, switch primitive, route a stabilising sequence, or bring in a human—only within consent and governed rules.  
## Governance (30–50 words)  
Governance defines roles, permissions, and auditability. It ensures that continuity scales without ambiguity. Governance is visible, enforced, and logged so trust is verifiable rather than assumed.  
  
## SPECS PAGE > Pillar Definitions (Extended)  
## ER — Emotional Regulation  
**Definition (50–80 words):** Emotional Regulation is the capacity to remain steerable under activation. RecoveryOS routes ER when state threatens to collapse choice: downshift, orienting, labeling, and micro-alignment. It’s not about feeling less. It’s about restoring control of prediction—so the next move can be chosen rather than defaulted. **What it routes:** Downshift primitives, state naming, somatic stabilisers, short alignment moves. **Example moment:** “My chest tightens and my brain starts sprinting. The OS routes a 20-second downshift and a one-line name, then seals the delta.”  
## SR — Self-Repair  
**Definition (50–80 words):** Self-Repair is the system’s ability to return after rupture—without turning the rupture into identity. RecoveryOS routes SR when there’s drift, a slip, or a break in integrity. The goal is to convert collapse into continuity: a repair sequence, a clean receipt, and a return to motion. **What it routes:** Repair scripts, amends prompts (when relevant), shame-soothing without clichés, return contracts. **Example moment:** “I did the old thing. Instead of spiraling, the OS routes a repair loop and seals: ‘I returned.’”  
## SC — Social Continuity  
**Definition (50–80 words):** Social Continuity protects connection while patterns activate. RecoveryOS routes SC when relationships become the arena of relapse: rupture, avoidance, people-pleasing, shutdown, conflict cycles. It routes micro-boundaries, co-regulation, and repair so the system stays relational without being unsafe. **What it routes:** Boundary micro-reps, co-regulation prompts, clean apology sequences, reconnection moves. **Example moment:** “I’m about to fire off the text that burns it down. The OS routes a pause + rewrite + boundary line, then seals what held.”  
## CR — Care Routing  
**Definition (50–80 words):** Care Routing is the delivery engine. RecoveryOS routes CR to match modality, primitive, and interaction to the moment’s constraints. It prevents flood by enforcing one move, one contract, one receipt. It protects integrity by keeping delivery coherent across time, people, and environments. **What it routes:** Modality selection, interaction format (glance/seed/thread), dose, timing, escalation pathways. **Example moment:** “I have 30 seconds. The OS routes a glance-level move that fits, not a lecture.”  
## II — Integrity Infrastructure  
**Definition (50–80 words):** Integrity Infrastructure makes trust a property of the system. RecoveryOS routes II when boundaries, permissions, and auditability matter: consent adherence, governance visibility, rails enforcement, sealed logs. II ensures the system can scale without becoming surveillance or chaos. **What it routes:** Consent enforcement, role-based visibility, integrity logs, deprecation maps, stable IDs. **Example moment:** “A trace is shared with my clinician. It’s exact, consent-bound, and logged—no ambiguity.”  
## DM — Drift Monitoring  
**Definition (50–80 words):** Drift Monitoring detects pattern movement early—before it becomes collapse. RecoveryOS routes DM through lightweight signals and micro-receipts that reveal trajectory without turning life into tracking. Drift isn’t failure. It’s information the OS uses to adjust route and dose. **What it routes:** Micro check-ins, pattern flags, readiness signals, review prompts, gentle course corrections. **Example moment:** “Three small misses in a week. The OS notices drift and routes a lower dose + earlier timing.”  
  
## SPECS PAGE > Stability Model  
## Section Headline  
**The return model.**  
## Body Copy (80–120 words)  
Stability in RecoveryOS isn’t “never wobble.” It’s how fast you return—without breaking integrity. The model treats recovery as continuity: a thread of routed moves and sealed receipts. When pressure rises, the OS doesn’t demand more effort; it adjusts dose, timing, and primitive to keep the thread unbroken. Review turns receipts into pattern visibility. Pattern visibility improves routing. Over time, return becomes default. Not through motivation. Through repeated proof under real conditions.  
  
## SPECS PAGE > Token System  
## Section Headline  
**The visual language.**  
## Body Copy (60–80 words)  
RecoveryOS uses a token system so the UI behaves like the OS: stable, scalable, and coherent across lenses. Tokens define spacing, type, motion, glow, rails, and states. Families map to the system’s mental model—Return, Thread, Trace, Handrail—so visuals reinforce behavior. The interface can evolve while the underlying meaning stays consistent.
