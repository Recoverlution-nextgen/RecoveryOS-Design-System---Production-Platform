Got it. I’ll curate the whole kit map from the **anchor points** (Return · Thread · Trace · Handrail · Drift · Grip · Compass · Carry) and treat your assets as the **cinematic atmosphere + product-object stage**—clean, abstract, universal, iconic.  
What follows is the **complete RecoveryOS Web Kit Map v1**: the system you hand to design + engineering and it just… builds.  
  
## RecoveryOS Web Kit Map v1  
## “The Continuity Layer” — one OS, three lenses  
## The anchor points (the only things the public needs to learn)  
These are the **product truths**, not framework terms.  
## Core nouns  
* **Return** (the universal action)  
* **Grip** (the small help you can accept)  
* **Thread** (continuity you carry)  
* **Trace** (quiet proof, made tangible)  
* **Handrail** (support without drama)  
* **Compass** (direction without instruction)  
* **Drift** (when you’re moving off-course)  
* **Carry** (the whole point: it comes with you)  
## Core verbs (UI language)  
* **Return**  
* **Choose**  
* **Run**  
* **Seal**  
* **Save**  
* **Review**  
* **Share** (by consent)  
* **Hand-off** (when needed)  
Everything in the kit exists to make these words feel *obvious*.  
  
## 1) The site architecture  
Not a sitemap. A **reveal architecture**.  
## Primary surface  
## /recoveryos — The Keynote Page  
One scroll. Cinematic. Minimal nav. One objective: **make Return feel inevitable.**  
## Secondary surfaces (supporting rooms)  
* /studio — try the OS (Return → Grip → Trace)  
* /thread — see continuity (Thread as a pass)  
* /vault — see proof (Trace objects)  
* /lens — see the three altitudes (Trace re-rendered)  
* /trust — handrails + consent + integrity (felt trust)  
* /platform — the organisation view (governance + reliability)  
* /stories — optional: real narratives (sparingly, high craft)  
No “about / features / pricing” vibe. If you need those, they’re tucked behind **Info** and stay short.  
  
## 2) The page stack (scene choreography)  
This is the **master map** the whole kit is built to support.  
## Scene 01 — Continuity  
**Goal:** establish that this is a life layer, not a program.  
* Abstract cinematic field (your assets shine here)  
* One line: “A layer you can carry.”  
* CTA: **Try Return**  
**Component(s):** ContinuityHero, ReturnButton  
  
## Scene 02 — Return (the signature)  
**Goal:** make Return a *physical* action.  
* Giant, iconic Return surface appears  
* Microcopy: “Return doesn’t require a reason.”  
**Component(s):** ReturnButton, ReturnExplainerMicro  
  
## Scene 03 — Grip (the small help)  
**Goal:** demonstrate the “small enough to happen” principle.  
* Pick: **Anchor / Compass / Handrail**  
* Pick: **10s / 30s / 2m**  
* Run one Grip  
**Component(s):** GripGenerator, GripPlayer  
  
## Scene 04 — Trace (proof made tangible)  
**Goal:** the moment becomes a *thing*.  
* After the Grip: “Save this as a Trace?”  
* The Trace object is born (beautiful, quiet)  
**Component(s):** TraceObjectReveal, TraceTile, SealMotion  
  
## Scene 05 — Thread (timeless pass)  
**Goal:** show it’s not isolated; it accumulates into a life-line.  
* The Thread appears as a continuous line  
* Traces become nodes on the Thread  
* Weekly rhythm implied without calling it “program”  
**Component(s):** ThreadView, ThreadNode, WeeklyFold  
  
## Scene 06 — Lens (same Trace, different meaning)  
**Goal:** unify the ecosystem with one object.  
Toggle: **Individual · Professional · Organisation** The *same* Trace transforms:  
* Individual: “Identity reinforcement”  
* Professional: “Clean signal”  
* Organisation: “Defensible continuity”  
**Component(s):** LensControl, TraceTravel  
  
## Scene 07 — Handrail (trust you can feel)  
**Goal:** safety as a design presence, not a promise.  
* Quiet Hours  
* Consent map  
* Hand-off flow preview  
**Component(s):** HandrailPanel, ConsentPanel, HandoffPreview  
  
## Scene 08 — Carry (closing)  
**Goal:** land the timeless promise.  
* Abstract cinematic field returns  
* One line: “Carry the layer. Keep moving.”  
* CTA becomes lens-aware:  
    * Individual: “Start your Thread”  
    * Professional: “Preview Care Lens”  
    * Organisation: “View Platform Brief”  
**Component(s):** CarryClosing, CTAStack  
That’s the keynote. Everything else is supporting depth.  
  
## 3) The Kit itself: tokens → objects → components → scenes  
## 3.1 Token Kit (semantic-first)  
Your tokens encode *meaning*, not palette.  
## Token families  
* return/* (the action surface)  
* grip/* (micro experience)  
* trace/* (object + seal)  
* thread/* (continuity line)  
* handrail/* (trust surfaces)  
* lens/* (altitude emphasis)  
* motion/* (arrive, glide, settle, confirm, carry)  
* field/* (abstract cinematic atmospheres)  
## Mode sets  
* appearance: light | dark  
* attention: calm | focus  
* accessibility: reduceMotion | highContrast  
**Key OS move:** attention modes are real product behavior:  
* Calm = wide, slow, breathy  
* Focus = tighter, decisive, fewer options  
  
## 3.2 Object Kit (OS artifacts)  
These are **publicly recognizable**, like iOS icons.  
```
ReturnButton

```
* the universal action  
* always available  
* one tap = run default Grip  
* press-and-hold = choose direction  
```
Grip

```
* a runnable micro experience  
* always ends with optional Trace  
```
TraceObject

```
* a tangible artifact  
* “Sealed” state is sacred (not celebratory)  
```
Thread

```
* the continuity pass  
* never framed as a streak  
```
Handrail

```
* safety infrastructure  
* quiet by default  
```
Lens

```
* altitude translation layer  
* transforms interpretation, not structure  
  
## 3.3 Component Kit (build-ready)  
## Primitives (standard but styled)  
* Surface, Card, Stack, Divider  
* Button, IconButton, SegmentedControl  
* Drawer, Modal, Toast (quiet)  
* Fold (progressive disclosure)  
## Signature components (the RecoveryOS “wow”)  
* ContinuityHero  
* ReturnButton (object + component)  
* GripGenerator (intent + time)  
* GripPlayer (runs the micro experience)  
* TraceObjectReveal (birth animation)  
* TraceTile (portable artifact)  
* ThreadView (continuity line)  
* TraceTravel (same object, three lenses)  
* HandrailPanel (trust infrastructure)  
* ConsentPanel (clean consent map)  
* HandoffPreview (human boundary)  
* CTAStack (lens-aware CTAs)  
## Governance / platform components (only visible in Org lens by default)  
* IntegrityPreview (audit artifact sample)  
* ReliabilityPanel (delivery reliability without “metrics porn”)  
* PolicyRails (what’s allowed / blocked / by consent)  
  
## 4) Asset system (you have the perfect style — here’s the map)  
Your assets are abstract, cinematic, universal. Great. That’s *exactly* how you make an OS feel timeless.  
## Asset families (roles)  
## A) Fields (primary)  
Abstract cinematic backgrounds that imply:  
* continuity  
* calm presence  
* depth  
* inevitability  
Used in: Hero, transitions, closings.  
## B) Signals (micro motion overlays)  
Subtle animated cues:  
* shimmer, drift, settle, confirm  
* never “exciting”  
* always regulating  
Used in: Return hover, Seal confirmation, Lens transitions.  
## C) Objects (product renders)  
Minimal, iconic renders of:  
* Return surface  
* Trace tile  
* Thread line  
* Handrail rail  
These should look like Apple hardware photography—crisp, quiet.  
## D) Moments (optional, sparingly)  
If you ever use human footage:  
* it’s “life moving,” not crisis  
* hands, doorways, light  
* universal, unbranded  
## Asset rules  
* Fields do 70% of the emotional work.  
* Objects do 70% of the explanatory work.  
* Text does 70% of the truth work. (Yes, that overlaps. That’s the point.)  
  
## 5) Motion language (the OS feel)  
Motion is not delight. Motion is **belief**.  
## Motion primitives (tokens)  
* **Arrive**: soft entrance (hero text, object reveals)  
* **Glide**: continuity (Thread movement, day overlay)  
* **Settle**: nervous system landing (after Grip)  
* **Confirm**: quiet acknowledgment (Seal)  
* **Carry**: object translation (TraceTravel across lenses)  
## Motion rules  
* nothing bounces  
* nothing spins  
* nothing celebrates  
* everything feels inevitable  
  
## 6) Lens system (same same but different)  
Lens changes **priority + interpretation**, not the OS.  
## Lens behavior map  
## Individual  
Default scenes emphasize: Return → Grip → Trace → Thread Trust is present but quiet.  
TraceTravel defaults to “Me view.”  
## Professional  
Default scenes emphasize: Trace → Thread → Lens (Care view) Trust expands; hand-off becomes clearer.  
## Organisation  
Default scenes emphasize: Trust → Integrity → Lens (System view) Demonstration still exists (Return), but it’s not the opener.  
**Same keynote. Different “first delight.”**  
  
## 7) Deliverable registries (so this becomes real)  
If you want this to ship cleanly, you build registries like an OS.  
## Token registry  
```
/tokens

```
* foundation.json  
* semantic.return.json  
* semantic.trace.json  
* semantic.thread.json  
* semantic.handrail.json  
* semantic.lens.json  
* motion.json  
* modes.json  
## Component registry  
```
/components

```
* /primitives  
* /objects  
* /signature  
* /panels  
* /platform  
## Scene registry  
```
/scenes

```
* ContinuityHero  
* Return  
* Grip  
* Trace  
* Thread  
* Lens  
* Handrail  
* CarryClosing  
Each scene includes:  
* layout  
* assets  
* motion  
* copy (per lens)  
This makes marketing + product + platform all speak one system.  
  
## The core map, in one line  
**Return creates a Grip. Grip becomes a Trace. Traces form a Thread. Handrails keep it safe. Lens makes it scale.**  
That’s the whole architecture. Everything else is styling and execution.  
  
If you want the next step, I’ll convert this map into a **build checklist** (MVP kit vs v1 vs v2) and a **component spec sheet** with variants/states for each signature component—so Figma + engineering can implement without interpretation.
