I’ll re-open your RecoveryOS markdown to pull the full system scope, then design an “out of this world” component spec sheet: signature story components (including a prompt-driven “website within a website”), their props/variants, and how they map to narrative beats across the three lenses.  
Here we go — **component spec sheet** that *tells the whole story* without “explaining the doc,” plus the **immersive, prompt-driven ‘website within a website’** that becomes the center of gravity.  
I’m going to treat your .md as the system substrate (loops, rooms, receipts, three worlds, trust, governance) and translate it into **a component language that reveals the OS** through experience.  
  
## RecoveryOS Web Component Kit v1  
## The site is an OS reveal: *feel → understand → trust → scale*  
## The master architecture (what components must accomplish)  
We have to render four realities from the doc, without reciting it:  
1. **It runs as a loop** (Sense → Route → Deliver → Seal).  
2. **It has rooms and tempos** (Journeys install baseline; NaviCues steer moments; one universal player).  
3. **It produces proof as objects** (receipts stack; identity follows; proof travels up the spine).  
4. **It is safe at scale** (consent by design, escalation protocols, integrity logs, governance LOCKED/CONTROLLED/EXPANDABLE).  
Everything in the spec below maps back to one of those.  
  
## Component tiers (so the site feels “iOS keynote,” not “marketing page”)  
## Tier A — Iconic OS Objects (recognizable, repeatable)  
* ReturnButton  
* TraceTile  
* ThreadLine  
* Handrail  
* LensControl  
## Tier B — Belief Machines (create aha moments)  
* LoopRunner  
* ReceiptForge  
* TraceTravel  
* ConductorView  
* SpineAtlas  
## Tier C — Trust Surfaces (make safety felt)  
* ConsentMap  
* IntegrityLogPreview  
* EscalationRail  
* GovernanceLockMap  
## Tier D — Immersive Explorers (the “website within a website”)  
* RecoveryOS Portal *(prompt-driven, exploratory, fully immersive)*  
  
## The flagship immersive component  
## 1) RecoveryOS Portal (Website-within-Website)  
**Purpose:** The interactive “OS environment” where people explore, run, and *see* RecoveryOS from any lens — without leaving the page.  
**Why this exists:** Your doc explicitly calls for guided corridors (not open chat) and orchestration “with a spine.” This is that — but *as a product reveal*.  
## 1.1 What it looks like (experience)  
A full-screen, cinematic “portal” that opens like an OS overlay:  
* abstract field background (your assets)  
* a calm prompt corridor (center)  
* a left “spine rail” (optional; collapsible)  
* a right “artifact rail” showing objects being created (Traces, Receipts, Logs)  
You don’t browse pages. You **move through rooms**.  
## 1.2 How it behaves (the OS loop as UX)  
The portal runs in cycles that mirror your system sequence: **Prompt → Signal → Route → Move → Receipt** …and optionally elevates to: **Experience → Recognition → Alignment → Proof**  
## 1.3 Inputs (prompt system)  
**Prompt types (not free text; guided choices + gentle typing):**  
* *Lens:* Individual / Professional / Organisation (always available)  
* *Intent:* “What do you want more of right now?” (Anchor / Clarity / Connection / Direction)  
* *Context:* “Where does this need to run?” (day / session / service)  
* *Tempo:* “Moment” or “Week” (maps to NaviCues vs Journeys)  
* *Depth Dial:* Glance / Seed / Thread / Journey (your interaction model)  
* *Trust Mode:* “Show the rails” (on/off) (reveals consent + integrity + escalation)  
## 1.4 Outputs (what the portal generates)  
The portal always produces one of three “artifacts”:  
* **Trace** (a personal receipt object)  
* **Signal** (a clinician-ready view: what happened, what held, what’s next)  
* **Integrity** (org view: logs, adherence, reliability)  
Same underlying object, different altitude — matching “receipt travels up the spine.”  
## 1.5 Internal modules (rooms inside the portal)  
These are selectable “tiles” that feel like apps inside the OS:  
1. **Run a Moment** *(NaviCue simulator)*  
    * Generates one micro-intervention and seals a receipt.  
2. **Install a Week** *(Journey simulator)*  
    * Shows the weekly cadence: Experience → Recognise → Align, then Proof.  
3. **Explore the Spine** *(Atlas)*  
    * Zoom map Pillars → Concepts → Themes → Schema → Mindblocks.  
4. **See Orchestration** *(LUMA conductor)*  
    * A feed “with a spine,” showing why this is routed now.  
5. **Trust & Rails** *(Safety surfaces)*  
    * Consent, quiet hours, escalation protocol preview, integrity logs.  
## 1.6 Variants + states  
**Variants**  
* lens: individual | professional | organisation  
* mode: calm | focus  
* depth: glance | seed | thread | journey  
* rails: hidden | visible  
**States**  
* idle (cinematic ambient)  
* prompting  
* routing (conductor animation)  
* running (player executing)  
* sealing (receipt creation)  
* elevating (TraceTravel across lenses)  
## 1.7 Motion & sound  
Motion tokens (conceptual):  
* **Arrive** (portal open)  
* **Glide** (room transitions)  
* **Settle** (post-move)  
* **Confirm** (seal)  
* **Carry** (artifact travels across altitudes)  
No celebration. Only inevitability.  
## 1.8 Accessibility + dignity  
* keyboard-first navigation  
* reduced motion mode  
* “skip experience” always available  
* nothing shaming; no “you failed” states  
* privacy copy is visible when rails are visible (consent by design)

**Output**  
* three stacked interpretations with same ID (labels evolve, IDs don’t)  
  
## 7) ThreadView (Continuity Surface)  
**Story job:** Make “motion” feel like a timeless pass.  
**Maps to:** “thousands of small rewires… compounding change”  
**UI**

**Story job:** Explain modules as rooms, not features.  
**Maps to:** Journeys, NaviCues, Toolkit, Wellbeing, State  
**Rooms**  
**Rooms**  
* **Journeys**: baseline install cycles  
* **NaviCues**: moment steering, mini-apps  
* **Toolkit**: meaning on demand (library, not engine)

**UI**  
* three rings (locked core, controlled middle, expandable edge)  
* hover reveals examples  
  
## “Out of this world” narrative mechanics  
## How components tell the whole story (without copy walls)  
## Mechanic 1 — Objects are the story  
The visitor doesn’t learn by reading. They learn by watching objects appear:  
* a move → a trace → a thread → a traveling receipt → a defensible log  
That mirrors your “delivery → proof → transfer” spine.  
## Mechanic 2 — Depth is a dial, not a page  
Glance/Seed/Thread/Journey becomes a universal UI control across the site. So anyone can go deeper *without leaving the current scene*.  
## Mechanic 3 — Lens changes interpretation, not structure  
Same component tree. Different defaults:  
* Individual defaults to felt relief + identity  
* Professional defaults to signal + coherence  
* Organisation defaults to rails + integrity  
Exactly like one OS, three altitudes.  
  
## The “portal” integration plan (how it sits in the website)  
You don’t send people to a separate product demo page.  
You embed the portal as:  
* a **section** on the keynote page (open in place)  
* a **full-page** experience at /studio  
* a **floating mini-portal** that can be reopened from any page (like an OS dock)  
This matches “You don’t navigate the system. The system meets you.”  
  
## If you want, I’ll do the next deliverable immediately  
I can turn this into a true **spec sheet format** your team can build from, with:  
* a **Component Registry table** (name, tier, story beat, dependencies)  
* per-component **Props / Variants / States / Events**  
* and a canonical **Portal prompt tree** (the exact prompts + routing logic per lens)  
No more theory — just build artifacts.
