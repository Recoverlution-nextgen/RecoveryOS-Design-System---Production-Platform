# Voice & Language Guidelines

**Status**: Active | **Last Updated**: Jan 2026

## Core Voice Principles

### The RecoveryOS Voice
**Quietly competent** + **Clinically precise** + **Soulfully human**

- **Competent**: We know what we're doing. No hype, no uncertainty.
- **Clinical**: Evidence-based, pattern-aware, safety-first.
- **Human**: Dignity-preserving, shame-free, hope-sustaining.

### Three Dialects

#### Individual Dialect ("You" Language)
**Lead with**: Ease + Dignity
**Focus**: Personal experience, emotional safety
**Examples**:
- "Return feels right when you need it"
- "Your thread carries what matters"
- "This trace is yours to keep"

#### Professional Dialect ("Person" Language)
**Lead with**: Continuity + Clarity
**Focus**: Clinical insight, pattern recognition
**Examples**:
- "The person's return pattern shows stability"
- "Thread continuity indicates engagement"
- "Trace data suggests positive momentum"

#### Organisation Dialect ("System" Language)
**Lead with**: Reliability + Governance
**Focus**: Infrastructure, defensibility, scale
**Examples**:
- "System uptime: 99.9% across all return events"
- "Thread integrity maintained across 500+ active users"
- "Trace audit trail complete and verifiable"

## Language Patterns

### Core Structure
**State** → **Intent** → **Move** → **Receipt**

Examples:
- "You're feeling unsettled → Would you like to return? → Here's your anchor → Trace captured"
- "Pattern shows drift → Compass available → Direction chosen → Route committed"

### Microcopy Rules

#### Do's
- **Short sentences**: Maximum 12 words
- **Active voice**: "You return" not "Return is initiated"
- **Present tense**: "This helps" not "This will help"
- **Concrete language**: "10 seconds" not "a moment"
- **Optional language**: "Would you like to..." not "You should..."

#### Don'ts
- **No shame words**: broken, failed, wrong, bad
- **No hype**: amazing, revolutionary, breakthrough
- **No medical jargon**: Unless in Professional/Org lenses
- **No absolutes**: never, always, must
- **No pressure**: urgent, immediately, now

### Tone Shifts by Context

#### Calm State
- **Supportive**: "I'm here when you need me"
- **Patient**: "Take your time"
- **Present**: "What's happening right now?"

#### Heat State (High arousal)
- **Simple**: "One thing at a time"
- **Direct**: "Here's what helps"
- **Brief**: "Ready when you are"

#### Success Moments
- **Quiet celebration**: "That landed well"
- **Acknowledgment**: "You chose that moment"
- **Forward-looking**: "Carries with you"

## Component-Specific Language

### ReturnButton
- **Individual**: "Return"
- **Professional**: "Guide"
- **Organisation**: "Stabilize"

### GripGenerator
- **Labels**: "Anchor", "Compass", "Handrail"
- **Descriptions**:
  - Anchor: "Settle where you are"
  - Compass: "Find your direction"
  - Handrail: "Safe support nearby"

### TraceTile
- **Creation**: "This moment becomes a trace"
- **Display**: "Your proof, made tangible"
- **Travel**: "Moves with you across lenses"

### Error States
- **Instead of "Error"**: "That didn't connect"
- **Instead of "Failed"**: "Let's try a different way"
- **Instead of "Invalid"**: "That format doesn't fit here"

## Content Hierarchy

### H1 (Page Title)
- **Purpose**: Sets context and expectation
- **Length**: 3-7 words
- **Examples**: "Your Return Journey", "Thread Continuity", "Trace Collection"

### H2 (Section Headers)
- **Purpose**: Organizes content areas
- **Length**: 2-5 words
- **Examples**: "Recent Returns", "Active Threads", "Trace Gallery"

### Body Copy
- **Line length**: 45-75 characters
- **Paragraphs**: 2-4 sentences maximum
- **Links**: Descriptive, not "click here"

### Microcopy (Buttons, Labels)
- **Actions**: Start with verb ("Save Trace", "View Thread")
- **States**: Clear status ("Trace Sealed", "Return Active")
- **Hints**: Helpful context ("10 seconds of calm")

## Cultural Considerations

### Universal Language
- **Avoid idioms**: "Piece of cake" means nothing in other cultures
- **Concrete over abstract**: "10 minutes" vs "a little while"
- **Inclusive imagery**: No gender, culture, or ability assumptions

### Translation Readiness
- **Short strings**: Easier to translate accurately
- **Context provided**: Give translators full context
- **Cultural testing**: Validate in target markets

## Voice Maintenance

### Review Process
1. **Content creation**: Write in primary dialect first
2. **Cross-dialect check**: Ensure consistency across lenses
3. **Clinical review**: Validate psychological safety
4. **User testing**: Confirm comprehension and emotional impact

### Quality Metrics
- **Readability**: Flesch score > 60
- **Sentiment**: Positive or neutral (no negative)
- **Clarity**: < 10% user confusion in testing
- **Consistency**: < 5% variance from guidelines

### Tools & Resources
- **Style Guide**: This document (updated quarterly)
- **Voice Examples**: Curated example library
- **Review Checklist**: Automated and manual checks
- **User Feedback**: Direct input on language effectiveness

## Emergency Language

### Crisis Moments
- **Simple**: "Help is here"
- **Direct**: "Connect to support"
- **Safe**: "You're not alone"

### System Issues
- **Honest**: "We're working on this"
- **Helpful**: "Try again in a moment"
- **Alternative**: "Use this backup method"
