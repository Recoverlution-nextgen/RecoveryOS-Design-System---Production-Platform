// This package contains outputs from Figma Make and other creative UI tools.
// It is kept separate from the canonical design system (packages/ui) to prevent cross-pollination.
// Use this space to push Figma-generated code, then cleanse and integrate into the design system.

// Export any components or assets here temporarily
