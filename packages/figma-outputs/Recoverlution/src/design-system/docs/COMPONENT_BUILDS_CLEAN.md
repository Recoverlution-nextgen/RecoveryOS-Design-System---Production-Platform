# Component Builds — Clinically Precise Copy

Tone: authoritative, warm, zero hype. Use verb-first microcopy. Keep receipts and routing clear. All CTAs are plain language.

## Clinical Spine Hero
- Headline: "Deterministic, auditable change pipeline."
- Subhead: "Problem to proof, one step at a time."
- Stage labels: Problem, Mechanism, Schema, Family, Mindblock, Proof, Transfer.
- Active panel lead: "What we do now" with 1-2 lines on the current stage.
- CTA: "Run routing simulation".

## Schema Constellation
- Headline: "20 predictive patterns, not diagnoses."
- Subhead: "Each schema holds its own families, voices, and proof routes."
- Node microcopy: "Pillar: {pillar}". Selected panel: "8 families ready. Proof routes attached."
- CTA: "Show families and proofs".

## Family Tree Explorer
- Headline: "Schemas -> Families -> Mindblocks."
- Subhead: "Pick a schema, see the families, open a mindblock."
- Column titles: Schemas, Families, Mindblocks.
- Mindblock chip: "Heat: RED | KBE: Believing".
- CTA: "Expand mindblock".

## Six Pillars Deep Dive
- Headline: "Six pillars. Physiology up to identity."
- Subhead: "Enter on the pillar that matches the present state."
- For the active pillar: quote, connected schemas, sample mindblocks, proof artifacts.
- "How it works" steps: Orient -> Downshift -> Capture receipt.
- CTA: "Open pillar detail".

## Voice Taxonomy
- Headline: "Eight clinical stances."
- Subhead: "Choose the stance that fits the heat and the job."
- Card front: Name, stance line, color chip.
- Back detail: When to use, pairings, sample mindblocks, optional audio: "Play 0:32 sample".
- CTA: "Flip card".

## Primitive Library
- Headline: "Primitive actions. Smallest moves."
- Subhead: "Pick the move, then pair voice and proof."
- Cards: title, one-line definition, icon.
- Detail pane: When to use (heat), proof required, sample navicue.
- CTA: "Play navicue" / "Use this primitive".

## Routing Engine
- Headline: "Route by archetype, not by content."
- Subhead: "Heat + KBE + schema -> archetype -> primitives, voice, proof."
- Left: archetype list with default heat.
- Right: routing logic with voices, primitives, families, proof requirements.
- CTA: "Run simulation" with a simple input line.

## Proof + Transfer System
- Headline: "Proof makes change auditable. Transfer makes it real."
- Subhead: "Capture the receipt, then repeat in a new context."
- Proof cards: name, metric, sample result (delta, duration, streak).
- Transfer cards: context change, deadline, status.
- CTA: "Log receipt" / "Start transfer test".

## Heat x KBE Matrix
- Headline: "State-based routing. Do not think in a fire."
- Grid cells: heat x knowing/believing/embodying with a primary primitive and mindblock count.
- Detail pane: why this combination, primary primitives, primary voices, 1-2 sample mindblocks.
- CTA: "Open cell" / "Back to matrix".

## Four-Layer Architecture
- Headline: "How everything connects."
- Layers: CC2 (governance), LUMA (decision OS), 6S Orbit (daily OS), Rooms (delivery).
- Each layer: what it is, who uses it, key functions, data flow note.
- CTA: "Expand layer" / "Simulate flow".

## Microcopy patterns
- Buttons: Run simulation, Show families, Open detail, Play sample, Log receipt, Start transfer test.
- Status tags: Heat RED/AMBER/GREEN, KBE Knowing/Believing/Embodying, Proof Ready, Transfer Pending/Complete.
- Avoid placeholders like "[Click]"; use direct verbs.

## Glossary (drop near first use)
- KBE: Knowing, Believing, Embodying.
- Navicue: Guided micro-intervention with voice and timer.
- Receipt: Proof artifact with a measurable delta.
- Transfer test: Repetition of the win in a new context.
- Archetype: Routing profile combining heat, schema pattern, and default primitives.
- Mindblock: If-X-then-Y pattern we aim to rewrite.

## Tone rules
- Plain, precise, warm. No hype words (amazing, magic). Use short sentences.
- Prefer verb-first CTAs. Keep casing in Title Case for headings, sentence case for body.
- Keep numbers concrete (e.g., "8 families", "90-second timer", "delta -4").
