DESIGN SYSTEM CONSTITUTION

Purpose
The design system exists to deliver deterministic, token-driven UI primitives that enable clinical-grade product behaviour for RecoveryOS.

Core principles

- Single source-of-truth for tokens
- Components are consumable, type-safe, and accessible
- Automated quality gates for every change
- Decisions are recorded and discoverable

Amendments

- Any change to these principles requires a DECISIONS.md entry and human authorisation.
