# Operating Truth

• **Rooms** (structured places you intentionally enter)
• **LUMA** (the ever-present conductor that brings the rooms to you — without the platform feeling like a menu)

If we build it right, it won’t feel like “a big app with features.”
It’ll feel like **one organism**.
Below is the **Operating Truth**: how to unify this without sterility, plus what the Player must do in each room + what LUMA must own.
**The Universal Player as One System, Many Rooms, One Conductor
The principle**
**Every room is different.Every room runs on the same primitives.**
So you don’t build 8 products.
You build **one engine** that renders **different experience patterns**.
The trick is:
Rooms differ by **cadence + rules + intent** — not by architecture.
**The shared primitives (the glue that stops it feeling generic)**
These are the “same bones” everywhere:
**1) Cue**
A Cue is the atomic unit of experience.
• has a purpose (probe / soothe / challenge / clarify / anchor)
• has a format (text, audio, choice, gesture, reflection, micro-video)
• has an outcome (signal captured, state shifted, action taken)
**2) Signal**
Any meaningful input/output:
• state logs (Energy / Clarity / Anchorage)
• reflections (text/voice)
• completion behaviors
• biometrics (optional)
• consent + escalation adherence
**3) Route**
How the system decides what’s next.
• deterministic (journey step-by-step)
• probabilistic (navicue stream)
• scheduled (wellbeing)
• on-demand (toolkit)
**4) Receipt**
The proof artifact.
Not “you finished 3 tasks.”
But: *what changed, what was seen, what was installed.*
Receipts are how this becomes defensible, motivating, and personal.
**5) Spine**
The continuity layer.
If you remove the spine, it becomes content soup.
Your spine is:
**Prompt → signal → route → move → receipt.**
That is the Universal Player’s *one sentence.*
**Room-by-room: what the Player handles
1a) Journey Room (E · R · A)**
**Shape:** sequential sprint.
**Tone:** cinematic, deliberate, “guided exposure with soul.”
**Player functions**
• Load a **Journey Sprint Manifest**
    ◦ 13+ cue screens
    ◦ step definitions (Experience → Introspection → Recognize → Introspection → Align → Introspection → Wrap)
• Enforce **sequence + pacing**
    ◦ no random jumps unless allowed
    ◦ recoverable resume if interrupted
• Run **scenario build + context layering**
    ◦ concept seeding
    ◦ embodied prompt timing
• Capture **introspection**
    ◦ voice note / message capture
    ◦ optional prompt scaffolding (“start here”)
• Branching logic (light, not chaotic)
    ◦ if user resists, soften
    ◦ if user escalates, ground
• Wrap with a **Sprint Receipt**
    ◦ what was experienced
    ◦ what was recognized
    ◦ what was aligned
    ◦ what to practice next
    ◦ optional “one-liner identity install”
**What makes it non-sterile**
• The Player must support **ritual**
    ◦ opening beat
    ◦ a breath/anchor
    ◦ “entering the room” sensation
• **Cinematic transitions**
• **Voice-first reflection** feels human, not form-like
**1b) Navicues (Neuroplastic atoms)**
**Shape:** infinite stream.
**Tone:** surprising, alive, intelligent.
**Rule:** “calibrated at request-time.”
**Player functions**
• Run a **Cue Stream Runtime**
    ◦ never-ending queue, but only generated when pulled
• **Moment-based calibration**
    ◦ based on current state, recent cues, friction signals, time-of-day, intent
• **Anti-staleness rules**
    ◦ novelty preservation
    ◦ avoid repeating themes too soon
    ◦ avoid being literal/obvious
• Multi-format delivery
    ◦ probes, mirrors, paradox keys, somatic scans, myth busters, practice shards
• Micro-interactions
    ◦ swipe decisions
    ◦ tap-to-expand
    ◦ “hold to breathe”
    ◦ quick voice capture
• Generate **micro-receipts**
    ◦ “what you just saw about your system”
• Safety rails
    ◦ de-escalation cues
    ◦ SOS surfaces
    ◦ consent-aware intensity
**What makes it non-sterile**
Navicues must feel like **artful intelligence**, not “tips.”
So the Player needs:
• **format diversity**
• **tone modulation**
• **symbolic language support** (science × spirituality × therapy)
• **aesthetic variation** (typography layouts, motion, sound beds)
**3) Wellbeing Studio (series + scheduling)**
**Shape:** curated clusters + routines.
**Tone:** premium, calm, “for our people.”
**Player functions**
• Clustered library playback
    ◦ series → episodes
    ◦ “next best” episode selection
• Scheduling
    ◦ “morning meditation”
    ◦ “post-craving reset”
• Adaptive recommendations
    ◦ based on state + recent load
• Watch/listen modes
    ◦ audio-first
    ◦ background play (where supported)
• Completion receipts
    ◦ not streaks — *regulation outcomes*
**Non-sterile factor**
The Player should carry a “studio feeling”:
• smooth transitions
• consistent intro/outro
• minimal friction to play
**4) Toolkit (meaning on demand + Bag)**
**Shape:** modular knowledge objects.
**Tone:** elegant, optional depth, never preachy.
**Player functions**
• Render multiple content types:
    ◦ Articles (calm line)
    ◦ Insights (depth)
    ◦ Practices (portable blocks)
    ◦ Soundbites (audio mode + beat)
    ◦ Sparks/Flames/Embers taxonomy
• “Anywhere injection”
    ◦ practices and soundbites can appear in Navicues/Journeys
• Bag
    ◦ save objects
    ◦ organize by intent (“when I’m anxious”, “when I’m romanticizing”, etc.)
• Audio engine
    ◦ tempo / mood / intent
    ◦ optional lyric-mode (your story → refrain)
**Non-sterile factor**
Toolkit becomes *alive* when:
• it’s not a library
• it’s a **found object** that arrives at the right time
**6) STATE (checkpoint)**
**Shape:** quick logging + signal dashboard.
**Tone:** truth without judgement.
**Player functions**
• State entry UX
    ◦ Energy / Clarity / Anchorage
• Trend visualization (lightweight)
• Context capture (optional)
    ◦ “what triggered this?”
• Routing input
    ◦ state instantly informs Navicues + LUMA decisions
**Non-sterile factor**
STATE must feel like:
• “I checked in with myself”
not
• “I filled out a metric form”
So: gesture-based, minimal text, beautiful.
**7) Momentum (defensibility + unique metrics)**
**Shape:** proof + continuity + integrity.
**Tone:** authoritative, safe at scale.
**Player functions**
• Compute and display your unique metrics:
    ◦ momentum curves
    ◦ integrity logs
    ◦ consent adherence
    ◦ escalation adherence
    ◦ delivery reliability
• Show “mindblock traffic light” (your language)
• Biometrics overlays (if integrated)
• Pillar mapping + cognition shifts
• Exportable receipts (for self, coach, clinician if permissioned)
**Non-sterile factor**
Momentum must look like:
• “my operating truth”
not
• “a dashboard template.”
That means: custom visual language, less charts-for-charts, more narrative proof.
**8) Navigate (continuity + community + support infra)**
**Shape:** feed + scheduling + coordination.
**Tone:** “if our gurus ran the feed.”
**Player functions**
• Curated feed runtime (not social noise)
• Scheduling + reminders
• Support graph
    ◦ SOS contacts
    ◦ professionals/alumni
    ◦ documents (plans/notes) permissioned
• Meeting finder integrations (AA/SMART)
• Events integrations (Meetup)
• Signal surfaces
    ◦ “you’re sliding” indicators
    ◦ “you’re stable” reinforcement
**Non-sterile factor**
This must feel like:
• care infrastructure
not
• messaging + groups.
So: less chatter, more signal.
**Settings / Integrations (Wearables, sleep, schedule)**
**Shape:** setup flows + permissions.
**Tone:** confidence, clarity, control.
**Player functions**
• Integration onboarding
• Permission handling
• Notification routing rules
• Biometrics ingestion + mapping to signals
**LUMA: the conductor that prevents feature-room fragmentation**
Rooms are intentional entry.
LUMA is the **ambient layer**:
• not a room
• not a feature list
• the **governed conductor** that routes dose + continuity
**What LUMA owns (non-negotiable)
1) The Feed With a Spine**
• dynamic feed (upcoming, reminders, suggested moves)
• navicue-forward (Instagram energy, but purposeful)
• every item is a **Cue** with:
    ◦ intent
    ◦ action
    ◦ receipt path
**2) LUMA PLAY**
• soundbites / Sparks / Flames / Embers
• “Apple Music for mind-heart-soul”
• routes audio by moment + state
**3) LUMA TALK**
• guided conversational corridor
• listens, but leads with dynamic prompts
• reduces infinite-text wandering
• converts conversation into **signals** + **routes
4) LUMA VOICE**
• always-on capture
• prompted at key moments
• becomes backstory mapping + signal generation
**5) Routing Brain**
LUMA decides:
• which room to invite
• when to keep you in-flow
• when to deepen
• when to soften
• when to escalate to support
**LUMA is the “moment grading” engine.
The big architecture decision you’re circling**
You’re right: *you probably can’t do everything “through LUMA” as a UI surface.*
So the clean split is:
**Rooms = high-intent experiences**
Journey Room, Wellbeing Studio, Toolkit deep dives, Momentum.
**LUMA = the continuity conductor**
Navicues, Talk, Voice, Play, feed, routing, and light “glanceable” state.
That keeps the platform from feeling like a corporate portal.
**The “Operating Truth” contracts (what we tell Codebase)**
If the agent is building infrastructure, these are the contracts that must exist:
**A) Experience Manifest (for rooms + LUMA surfaces)**
• blocks
• cues
• routes
• actions
• triggers
• policies (safety, consent, intensity)
**B) Signal Schema**
• state signals
• reflection signals (text/voice)
• behavior signals
• biometric signals (optional)
• all with privacy rules
**C) Route Engine**
• deterministic route (journeys)
• probabilistic route (navicues)
• scheduled route (wellbeing)
• on-demand route (toolkit)
**D) Receipt Engine**
• generates proof objects
• renders receipts as UI
• powers Momentum
If those four exist, everything else becomes “rooms with style.”
**The non-sterile UI rule**
To keep it Apple-grade + sentient-soul:
• **Motion is not decoration. It’s comprehension.**
• **Typography is not styling. It’s guidance.**
• **Receipts are not badges. They’re identity proof.**
• **LUMA is not a chatbot. It’s a conductor.**
If you want, next I’ll do two things (tight, build-ready):
1. **Define the 10–15 Navicue formats** (with rules for novelty, tone, and engagement so it never feels obvious).
2. Draft a **minimal v1 Player scope** (what ships first that still feels like the “one conductor,” not a prototype).
