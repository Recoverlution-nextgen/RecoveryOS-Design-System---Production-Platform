# RecoveryOS Public Language System

## The Category: Continuity Layer for Human Change

**Core Promise**: "You don't have to remember who you are. RecoveryOS helps you return to it."

## Anchor Points (Public-Facing Vocabulary)

These are the **only words** the public needs to learn:

### Core Nouns
- **Return** — The universal action (not reset, not fix)
- **Grip** — The small help you can accept
- **Thread** — Continuity you carry (not a streak, a life-line)
- **Trace** — Quiet proof, made tangible
- **Handrail** — Support without drama
- **Compass** — Direction without instruction
- **Drift** — When you're moving off-course (non-shaming)
- **Carry** — The whole point: it comes with you
- **Anchor** — A stabilizer you can touch
- **Bridge** — The thing between intention and reality

### Core Verbs (UI Language)
- **Return** — Come back to yourself
- **Choose** — Pick direction/time
- **Run** — Execute a Grip
- **Seal** — Save as Trace
- **Save** — Store for continuity
- **Review** — Reflect on Thread
- **Share** — By consent only
- **Hand-off** — When escalation needed

## Three Dialects (Same Words, Different Emphasis)

### Individual Dialect (Apple Music vibe)
**Lead with**: Ease + Dignity
**Key words**: Return · Carry · Anchor · Handrail · Thread
**Proof is**: **Trace** (not metrics)
**Tone**: Personal, intimate, non-judgmental

### Professional Dialect (Apple Events nerd)
**Lead with**: Continuity + Clarity
**Key words**: Drift · Bridge · Trace · Compass · Thread
**Proof is**: **Signal** (clean patterns, not noise)
**Tone**: Insightful, pattern-focused, supportive

### Organisation Dialect (Apple Developer)
**Lead with**: Reliability + Governance
**Key words**: Handrail · Trace · Bridge · Thread · **Integrity**
**Proof is**: **Audit-grade Trace** (defensible continuity)
**Tone**: Infrastructure, systemic, defensible

## Forbidden Language

**Never use externally**:
- "Schema", "Heat band", "Mindblock", "Rewriter"
- "Relapse", "Crisis", "Failure"
- "Compliance", "Adherence" (use "Continuity" instead)
- "Metrics", "KPIs" (use "Signal" or "Trace")
- "Program", "Plan" (use "Thread" or "Layer")

**Internal → External Translation**:
- Sense→Route→Deliver→Seal → **Return Loop** (when we must name it)
- ERA Cadence → **Weekly Rhythm** or **Thread Review**
- Heat Band → **Drift Level**
- Proof Receipt → **Trace Object**
- Escalation → **Hand-off** (with consent)

## Tone Rules

### Universal
- Physical, not academic
- Felt, not explained
- Timeless, not trendy
- Dignity-first, never performative

### Individual
- "You" language (second person)
- Short sentences
- Breathing room
- Non-shaming drift language

### Professional
- "Person" language (third person caring)
- Pattern language ("When this happens...")
- Signal clarity
- Supportive without rescuing

### Organisation
- "System" language
- Infrastructure metaphors
- Reliability language
- Audit-ready but not compliance-shaming

## Component Naming Convention

### Objects (PascalCase nouns)
- `ReturnButton`
- `TraceObject`
- `ThreadLine`
- `HandrailRail`
- `GripPlayer`

### Actions (VerbNoun)

- `RunGrip`
- `SealProof`

### Spaces (*Room suffix)

## Copy Patterns

### Call-to-Actions
**Individual**:
- "Start your Thread"
- "Try Return"
- "Save this Trace"

**Professional**:
- "Preview Care Lens"
- "See Signal"
- "Review Patterns"

**Organisation**:
- "View Platform Brief"
- "Explore Integrity"
- "Audit Continuity"

### Microcopy
- "Return doesn't require a reason."
- "The small help you can accept."
- "A line you can return to."
- "Proof you can feel."
- "Support without drama."

## Visual Language Alignment

All copy must work with:
- **Cinematic Reality** assets (quiet moments, becoming)
- **OS Objects** (tangible, glass/metal finishes)
- **System Maps** (architectural, clear topology)
- **Field Atmospheres** (subtle, non-intrusive)
- **Micro-Motion** (regulation-grade, spring physics)

Copy is **etched into assets**, not overlaid.
