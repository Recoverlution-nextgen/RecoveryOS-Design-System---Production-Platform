# RECOVERLUTION: MAPPING THE PERIODIC TABLE OF THE MIND

## CONTEXT: WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

Recoverlution is a sophisticated SaaS therapeutic platform with LUMA as the AI orchestration layer. We've successfully deployed 500 NaviCues (therapeutic interventions) and established a working Stripe checkout flow with Foundation (£99) and Professional (£199) tiers.

**Current Database:** Consolidated Supabase project `wzeqlkbmqxlsjryidagf`

## THE CORE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING

We've identified that our current 500 NaviCues only address a "slither" of therapeutic need. They focus on surface-level self-report theater rather than creating real belief change.

**The Missing Piece:** We don't have a complete map of all the concepts, frameworks, and mindset shifts that exist across therapy, neuroscience, and philosophy. Without this map, we can't:
- Know what we're missing
- Route users to the right interventions
- Track progress systematically
- Create personalised belief-update systems
- Test what actually works

**The Solution Vision:** Create the "Periodic Table of the Mind" - a complete ontology of approximately 10,000 concepts that serves as the source of truth for everything in the platform.

## THE CLINICAL FOUNDATION: 6-PILLAR BLUEPRINT

All concepts must map to our six clinical pillars. These pillars represent the foundational domains of psychological wellbeing:

### **PILLAR 1: EMOTIONAL REGULATION**
The capacity to understand, experience, and modulate emotional states effectively.

**Core domains include:**

## THE TAXONOMY: FOUR-TIER ARCHITECTURE

Our belief is that psychological transformation follows this hierarchy:

```
PILLAR (6 total)
  ↓
CONCEPT (~10,000 total)
  ↓
THEME (5-10 per concept)
  ↓
MINDBLOCK (2-3 per theme)
```

### **CONCEPT DEFINITION**

A concept is a discrete, well-defined psychological construct, framework, or mechanism from therapy, neuroscience, or philosophy.

**Examples:**
- Cognitive Distortions (Beck, CBT)
- Window of Tolerance (Siegel, Neuroscience)
- Early Maladaptive Schemas (Young, Schema Therapy)
- Psychological Flexibility (Hayes, ACT)
- Prediction Error (Neuroscience)
- Dependent Origination (Buddhist Psychology)
- Dichotomy of Control (Stoicism)

**Each concept must include:**
- Name (precise terminology)
- Definition (clear, clinical)
- Source discipline (CBT, DBT, Schema Therapy, Neuroscience, ACT, IFS, Buddhist Psychology, Stoicism, Existential, etc.)
- Thought leader / originator (Beck, Siegel, Young, etc.)
- Pillar mapping (which of the 6 pillars it belongs to)
- Related concepts (cross-references)

### **THEME DEFINITION**

A theme is a specific manifestation or application of a concept in lived experience.

**Example - Concept: "Cognitive Distortions"**
- Theme 1: All-or-nothing thinking in relationships
- Theme 2: Catastrophising about work performance
- Theme 3: Mind-reading in social situations
- Theme 4: Should statements about self
- Theme 5: Emotional reasoning in decision-making

### **MINDBLOCK DEFINITION**

A mindblock is the atomic unit of mindset transformation. It represents a specific limiting belief, automatic thought pattern, or mental obstacle that prevents growth.

**Example - Theme: "All-or-nothing thinking in relationships"**
- Mindblock 1: "If they don't text back immediately, they don't care about me"
- Mindblock 2: "One argument means the relationship is doomed"
- Mindblock 3: "I'm either fully lovable or completely unworthy"

**Mindblocks are:**
- Trackable (red/amber/green status indicators)
- Targetable (NaviCues map to specific mindblocks)
- Measurable (progress can be assessed)
- The unit that everything else serves

## THE THREE-LAYER NAVICUE TRANSFORMATION SYSTEM

We've identified that real belief change requires three layers, based on neuroscience:

### **LAYER 1: KNOWING (Implicit Model Capture)**

Current problem: Self-report asks "What do you believe?" but people don't have conscious access to implicit beliefs.

What's needed: Behavioral probes that reveal beliefs through choices, reaction times, predictions, and patterns - not self-report.

### **LAYER 2: BELIEVING (Prediction Error Generation)**

Current problem: Insight alone doesn't change beliefs. The brain updates beliefs when predictions are violated.

What's needed: Safe micro-experiments that create gentle contradictions of old frameworks. Design real-world tests where reality contradicts limiting beliefs, generating prediction errors that update neural models.

### **LAYER 3: EMBODYING (Automaticity + Identity)**

Current problem: New insights fade without integration into automatic responses and sense of self.

What's needed: Repetition that builds automaticity, identity receipts that prove transformation, and transfer training that generalises learning across contexts.

## WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE

### **PRIMARY GOAL**

Create a complete, structured database that maps approximately 10,000 concepts from therapy, neuroscience, and philosophy according to our four-tier taxonomy (Pillar → Concept → Theme → Mindblock).

### **WHY THIS MATTERS**

With this complete map:

1. **Source of Truth:** Every NaviCue can be tagged to specific mindblocks it addresses
2. **Coverage Analysis:** We can see gaps - what concepts/mindblocks have no interventions
3. **Personalised Routing:** LUMA can route users based on their mindblock profile (red/amber/green status)
4. **Progress Tracking:** User progress maps to specific mindblocks transforming from red → amber → green
5. **Testing Framework:** We can measure what actually works by tracking mindblock status changes
6. **Content Generation:** We can systematically create NaviCues to address uncovered mindblocks
7. **Clinical Validity:** Everything grounds to established therapeutic frameworks

### **SECONDARY GOALS**

- Enable search and discovery ("Show me all concepts related to attachment")
- Support clinical research (coverage across modalities)
- Create learning pathways (prerequisite relationships between concepts)
- Build confidence in comprehensiveness ("We've mapped the territory")

---

## THE DATABASE CHALLENGE

We need to populate this taxonomy with approximately 10,000 concepts. Each concept needs:

- Precise name
- Clear definition
- Source discipline
- Thought leader/originator
- Pillar mapping (could map to multiple pillars)
- 5-10 themes (specific manifestations)
- 2-3 mindblocks per theme (specific limiting beliefs)

**The scale:**
- 10,000 concepts
- ~75,000 themes (average 7-8 per concept)
- ~150,000 mindblocks (average 2 per theme)

---

## CURRENT STATE

**What we have:**
- 6 pillars (clearly defined above)
- Taxonomy architecture (Pillar → Concept → Theme → Mindblock)
- 500 existing NaviCues (content delivery, needs to be tagged to mindblocks)
- Clear vision of three-layer transformation system (KNOWING, BELIEVING, EMBODYING)

**What we don't have:**
- The actual 10,000 concepts mapped
- Database schema for storing this taxonomy
- Themes and mindblocks generated from concepts
- Relationships and cross-references between concepts
- Coverage analysis of what exists vs what's missing

---

## QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION

We're NOT prescribing solutions. We want to understand:

1. **Data Architecture:** How should this taxonomy be structured in Supabase for maximum flexibility and query performance?

2. **Population Strategy:** What's the most efficient way to populate 10,000 concepts with quality and clinical accuracy? 

3. **AI Assistance:** Can AI (Claude, GPT) help generate themes and mindblocks from concepts systematically?

4. **Validation:** How do we ensure clinical accuracy and completeness?

5. **Relationships:** How do we model cross-references, prerequisites, and relationships between concepts?

6. **Evolution:** This will grow and change - how do we version and update without breaking existing user data?

7. **Search/Discovery:** Users and clinicians need to find concepts - what search capabilities are needed?

8. **Coverage Tracking:** How do we track which mindblocks have NaviCues addressing them vs gaps?

---

## DESIGN SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS

All frontend work must respect infiniteK design system:

**Brand Colors:**
- Primary: #3E2BB8
- Secondary: #5739FB

**Strict Rules:**
- THE ANCHOR RULE: NO CARD ON CARD. NO TILE ON TILE. NO BORDER ON BORDER
- No emojis anywhere
- No dashes site-wide
- No minimising words
- No rounded corners throughout entire design

---

## INTEGRATION POINTS

This concept library must integrate with:

1. **LUMA (AI orchestration):** Needs to route users based on mindblock assessment
2. **NaviCue Arsenal:** 500 existing + new ones need mindblock tagging
3. **User Progress Tracking:** Red/amber/green status per mindblock
4. **Sound Bites System:** "6 S's" architecture (STATION, SOUNDTRACKS, STORY, STICKYNOTES, SHELF, SEARCH)
5. **Stripe Billing:** Foundation (£99) and Professional (£199) tiers

---

## WHAT WE'RE ASKING

Please review this vision and provide recommendations on:

- Database schema design for this taxonomy
- Population and generation strategies
- Quality assurance approaches
- Integration architecture
- Scalability considerations
- Any blind spots or challenges we haven't considered

We want your expertise on the best way to build this foundation that will serve as the source of truth for the entire platform.
