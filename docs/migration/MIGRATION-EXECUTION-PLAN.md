# ⚡ MIGRATION EXECUTION PLAN - READY TO RUN

**What I can do RIGHT NOW with your connected tools:**

---

## 🔥 OPTION 1: FULL AUTOMATED MIGRATION (Recommended)

I'll execute everything in sequence:

### Step 1: GitHub Repository (5 min)
✅ Create `recoverlution-platform` repository  
✅ Push all current code in organized commits:
- Commit 1: Foundation (package.json, config files)
- Commit 2: Design system + styles
- Commit 3: Marketing suite (Home, Story, Platform, Science, Pricing, Demo, Therapy)
- Commit 4: Platform pages (Dashboard, Journey, Wellbeing, State, Toolkit, Navigate, Momentum, Profile)
- Commit 5: LUMA system (Home, Voice, Play, Talk)
- Commit 6: NaviCue Arsenal (20+ new types - tonight's work)
- Commit 7: Backend (Supabase, Stripe, edge functions)
- Commit 8: Documentation

✅ Create `develop` branch  
✅ Add comprehensive README.md

### Step 2: Jira Project Structure (10 min)
✅ Create **RECOVERLUTION** project (key: REC)  
✅ Create 9 Epics:
1. **REC-1**: Marketing Suite V2 (Exhibition Ready)
2. **REC-2**: Platform Core (Patient Experience)
3. **REC-3**: LUMA (AI Orchestration)
4. **REC-4**: NaviCue Arsenal (Therapeutic Delivery)
5. **REC-5**: Sound Bites System (Your Voice + Library)
6. **REC-6**: Clinical Foundation (6-Pillar Blueprint)
7. **REC-7**: Design System (infiniteK)
8. **REC-8**: Backend Infrastructure
9. **REC-9**: Deployment & DevOps

✅ Create 30+ initial stories under each epic  
✅ Set up Kanban board with proper workflow

### Step 3: Notion Documentation (15 min)
✅ Create workspace structure with 7 main sections:
- 🏠 Home
- 📖 Documentation
- 🎨 Design System
- 🧠 Clinical Foundation
- 🎯 Product
- 🚀 Engineering
- 💼 Business

✅ Create key pages:
- System Architecture Overview
- infiniteK Design System Guide (THE ANCHOR RULE, no rounded corners, glass effects)
- 6-Pillar Clinical Blueprint (ER, SR, SC, CR, II, DM)
- NaviCue Arsenal Documentation (all 20+ types)
- Development Setup Guide
- API Reference
- Deployment Checklist

✅ Import content from existing /docs/ and /guidelines/

---

## 🎯 OPTION 2: STEP-BY-STEP (Your Control)

You tell me what to do first, I'll do it, you review, we iterate.

Example flow:
1. **You**: "Create the GitHub repo first"
2. **Me**: *Creates repo, shows you the URL*
3. **You**: "Looks good, now push the marketing suite"
4. **Me**: *Pushes marketing code, shows commit*
5. **You**: "Perfect, let's set up Jira now"
6. ... and so on

---

## 📋 OPTION 3: COMPONENT MIGRATION (Gradual)

Migrate one system at a time:

### Week 1: Marketing Suite
- GitHub: Push marketing pages
- Jira: Create EPIC-1 + 10 stories
- Notion: Marketing documentation

### Week 2: Platform Core
- GitHub: Push platform pages
- Jira: Create EPIC-2 + 15 stories
- Notion: Platform architecture

### Week 3: LUMA + NaviCues
- GitHub: Push LUMA + NaviCue Arsenal
- Jira: Create EPIC-3 + EPIC-4
- Notion: AI orchestration docs

## ⚡ WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

**To start the automated migration, I need you to confirm:**

1. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Name: `recoverlution-platform` (or different name?)
   - Visibility: Private or Public?
   - Organization: Your personal account or create org?

2. **Jira Project**:
   - Name: RECOVERLUTION
   - Key: REC
   - Template: Kanban or Scrum?

3. **Notion Workspace**:
   - Create new workspace or use existing?
   - Create database for each epic or simple pages?

---

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED: FULL AUTOMATED MIGRATION

**Just say "GO" and I'll:**
1. Create GitHub repo (private, under your account)
2. Push all code in 8 organized commits
3. Create Jira project with 9 epics + 30 stories
4. Set up Notion workspace with full documentation
5. Give you a summary with all links

**Total time**: ~30 minutes  
**Your time**: 0 minutes (I do everything)  
**Result**: Professional workflow ready to use

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

Do **OPTION 1: Full Automated Migration** but let me show you the results at each phase:

**Phase 1**: I create GitHub repo + push code → you review  
**Phase 2**: I create Jira structure → you review  
**Phase 3**: I create Notion docs → you review  

This way you stay in control but don't have to micromanage every step.

## ❓ QUESTIONS?

- Want to change the repository name?
- Need different Jira epic structure?
- Have specific Notion organization preferences?
- Want to exclude anything from migration?

**I'm ready when you are!** 🎯
