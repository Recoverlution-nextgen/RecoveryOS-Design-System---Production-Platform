## ⚠️ PENDING SETUP

### GitHub Repository
**Status:** ❌ Permission Issue  
**Issue:** GitHub integration requires additional write permissions

**What needs to happen:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/apps/figma-make
2. Grant "Repository permissions" → "Contents" → "Read and write"
3. Then I can create `recoverlution-platform` repository
4. Push all code in organized commits

**Alternative Manual Setup:**
```bash
# Create repo manually on GitHub
# Then in terminal:
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Finchy23/recoverlution-platform.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Recoverlution platform foundation"
git push -u origin main
```

### Jira Project
**Status:** ❌ Needs Manual Creation  
**Issue:** Jira API doesn't support project creation via MCP tools

**What needs to happen:**
1. Go to: https://danielfincham.atlassian.net
2. Create new project:
   - Name: **RECOVERLUTION**
   - Key: **REC**
   - Type: **Kanban** (or Scrum if you prefer sprints)
   - Template: Software development
3. Once created, tell me the project key and I'll populate it with:
   - 9 Epics (Marketing, Platform, LUMA, NaviCue, Sound Bites, Clinical, Design, Backend, DevOps)
   - 50+ Stories and Tasks
   - Proper workflow (Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Review → Done)

**Manual Jira Setup Guide:**
1. Click "Create project"
2. Choose "Kanban" template
3. Name: RECOVERLUTION
4. Key: REC (should auto-populate)
5. Click "Create"

Then I can:
- Create all 9 epics
- Create stories under each epic
- Set up proper labels and priorities
- Configure workflow states
