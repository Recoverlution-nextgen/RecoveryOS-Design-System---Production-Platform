# RecoveryOS Website - Copy Request Document

**Purpose**: Comprehensive list of all copy needed for the marketing website across all 6 pages.

**Philosophy**: Copy follows "our way" - abstract enough to be universal, precise enough to feel engineered. No wellness language. No clinical clichés. RecoveryOS language.

---

## Copy Tone Guidelines

**DO**:
- Use RecoveryOS language: "routed", "sealed", "trace", "spine", "lens", "altitude"
- Focus on system behavior: "what the OS does" not "what you should do"
- Abstract + precise: "Moments become receipts" not "Track your feelings"
- Engineering-grade: "Proof crystallizing" not "Evidence gathering"
- Apple-grade clarity: Short sentences. Active voice. No fluff.

**DON'T**:
- Wellness language: "mindfulness", "self-care", "mental health journey"
- Clinical clichés: "healing process", "therapeutic intervention", "coping strategies"
- Hand-holding: "You've got this!", "Be kind to yourself"
- Marketing fluff: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "life-changing"
