# RecoveryOS Design System — Constitution

## Single source of truth
The blueprint is truth. Everything else is implementation.

## The four realities
1) Runs as a loop: Sense → Route → Deliver → Seal
2) Has rooms + tempos: Journeys + NaviCues
3) Produces proof as objects: Receipts stack; proof travels
4) Safe at scale: Consent, quiet hours, escalation, integrity logs

## Laws
- Tokens are law: no literals (color/spacing/motion/focus)
- Reduced motion is respected
- UI never leaks internal engine language
- All major objects snapshot across lenses + bands
- Axe must pass on snapshot routes
- Every object can emit governed events

## Releases
- Token/meaning changes are versioned and intentional
- Feel changes require a decision log entry
